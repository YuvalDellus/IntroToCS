==================

1) create_list - convert strings from user input to a list.
2) concat_list - convert list to a string.
3) average - do average to all numbers in a list.
4) cyclic - determine if a list is cyclic of a given list.
5) histogram - generating the histogram of a given list.
6) prime_factors - calculate the prime factors of a number.
7) cartesian - generates cartesian product of 2 give lists.
8) pairs - checks if addition of 2 numbers in a list can equal
           to a given number.


======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================

1. cyclic('abcd','bcda') -
The program will crush in that case cause the comparision part of the function
 is done by list manipulation, and the argument we given is from string type.
 if the two argument were equal we would get the a True as return.

 2. histogram(3,[1,2,3,4]) -
The program will crush from 2 reasons:
first, we given n', parameter that determine the length of the histogram, that
is is smaller than the length of the numbers list we given. at this situation
we wont have enough place in the histogram to contain all the numbers indexes.
 second, even if the n' parameter was equal by length, we wont have enough
 place in the histogram because we save place for the number 0 at the index 0,
 which the histogram start with.

 3. prime_factors(0) -
The program will return "[]", that because it's the initial list of prime
factors of any given number. The code start to fill the list on primes factors
by running on a loop in range of sqrt of the number, sqrt of 0 is 0 therefor
the loop won't run and the list wo'nt fill.

4. pairs(2,[0,0,1,1,2,2]) -
The code will return "[[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2]]", because the numbers
 are double and it will on 0 twice and on 2 twice. it won't return "[1, 1]"
 because I made a check to ensure that the list won't run on itself on same
 number.
