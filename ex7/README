=============================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================

A program that takes different tasks and find the recursive solution to them.
the program have to parts:
In the first part we execute 5 function that use simple recursion,
the functions call themselves and by doing that on smaller and smaller inputs
find the solution.
The second part of the program is function the execute the recursive idea, but
use assist function to do so, they take the input and slightly manipulate it
or generate more information from it and send all to othen function to help
answer the task.
