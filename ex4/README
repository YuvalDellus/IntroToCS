======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================

The program is fully capable to be played in Hebrew, the only things you need
to do is change the encoding type in the load_words function in the
hangman_helper and change the restricts of the non valid letters in the hangman
program to those which not accept non-hebrew letters,

len(letter) != 1 or not (ord("א") <= ord(str(letter)) <= ord("ת"))

works fine in my computer
